- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kellisson Felipe, software developer for a living, brazilian breathing machine on the rest of the day.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in music, books, games (and game dev), drawing and improve myself as a sofware developer. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning software testing, refactoring and architecture. Outside of computing I like to read and learn about guitars and synthesizers, music production, drawing and politics.
- ğŸ“« Hit me up on https://bit.ly/3Ayqlut :)
